-------------------------- inspectr 0.3-0 (2012-03-12) --------------------------
* ids can be returned as a data.frame or a vector (using as.vector option of ids())
* ids can be collated to the features in the features() method
* New rbind.Spectra*() method
* add() method removed
* new cut() method to select or remove WLs
* new apply_spectra() method
* various improvements on the plotting routine
* Added plot_summary() method
* Bugfixes on aggregate_spectra()
* spectra() now returns wavelengths specified by the @wl slot
* Added proper split-apply-combine strategy for aggregate_spectra()
* features()<- method introduced
* first prototype of a soil data support
* `[` method improved to support negative indices
* `[i, j, k, ...` method introduced for SpectraDataFrame. i for rows, j for data cols, k for spectra
* Fixed and improved as.data.frame() methods
* improved melt_spectra() method. Now accepts a attr=... option for SDF.
* resolution method renamed res to avoid conflict with ggplot2
* removed unseparate() method as rbind() is doing the exact same thing now
* separate() now available for Spectra objects
* bugfixes on mutate()
* introduced distinct spectra_wide<- and spectra_long<- initialising functions
* `[[` and `$` can now be used to promote a Spectra to a SpectraDataFrame object

-------------------------- inspectr 0.2-0 (2011-11-10) --------------------------
* Switch the get_data()/data() methods to features() (as data() is protected)
* Introduced sp bindings - and thus new spatial aware classes
* Changed classes definitions location in a single file

-------------------------- inspectr 0.1-7 (2011-06-20) --------------------------
* Changed package name and swithed to R-forge

-------------------------- specstore 0.1-6 (2011-06-07) --------------------------
* bug fix of aggregate_spectra (bug #1, "evaluation nested too deeply" error)

-------------------------- specstore 0.1-5 (2011-06-01) --------------------------
* bug fix when initializing a Spectra object without any id field.

-------------------------- specstore 0.1-4 (2011-05-31) --------------------------
* `[i, j, ..` method now accepts j values to subset the wavelengths

-------------------------- specstore 0.1-3 (2011-05-26) --------------------------
* split() now works for any class inheriting from Spectra
* New spectra<-.Spectra method, allowing to change the spectra of a Spectra* object by passing a matrix with the same number of rows.

-------------------------- specstore 0.1-2 (2011-05-25) --------------------------
* Method get_units() is now called units()
* Method get_resolution() is now called resolution()
* Method get_data() is now called data()
* New units<- method (changes the unit in which the wavelengths are expressed)
* New split.SpectraDataFrame method, see ?split
* mutate() is now implemented as one only method (not anymore duplicated for each Class), and is now working properly with attributes. You can even muate the spcetra and the attributes of an object in one command.

-------------------------- specstore 0.1-1 (2011-05-24) --------------------------
* proper package structure and documentation
* first semi-public release
