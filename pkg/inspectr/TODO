-------------- Short term --------------------

- Clean the NAMESPACE

- Put some sample data (and document it)
- Documentation, documentation
- Push the SpatialSpectraDataFrame class

- allow rbind to work on Spectra + SpectraDataFrames (including NA for Spectra individuals)
- what about cbind/strategy to add wavelengths to a collection?

- Implement a sample.Spectra() method
- Implement the Kennard-Stone algorithm for sampling

- outlier analysis methods (Mahalonobis?) --> Just an illustration in the vignette, use package:chemometrics
- 2D correlation between two sets of spectra --> same

- Document how to centre the spectra --> apply_spectra(foo, scale)
- Implement wavelet-based wl selection
- Implement the parameter orthogonalisation algorithm (Roger et al., 2003)

------------- Longer term --------------------

- File-based storage of big collections
- Integration of a viewer, possibly using playwith, to
manipulate (eg crop) the spectra in a collection.
