-------------- Short term --------------------

- Clean the NAMESPACE
- Get things clearer on the S4/S3 methods

- Put some sample data (and document it)
- Push the SpatialSpectraDataFrame class
- Find a quick way to use the baseline package (wrapper)

- Finish the integration of the smooth method (esp. implement the kernel smoother)
- The latter is a way to subsample the spectral resolution maybe?

- Implement a sample.Spectra() method
- Implement the Kennard-Stone algorithm for sampling
- mutate() should be able to apply diff()
- outlier analysis methods (Mahalonobis?)
- 2D correlation between two sets of spectra

- Document how to centre the spectra
- Same for variance scaling (maybe that would justify coding up a spectra_apply() kind of function?)
- Implement wavelet-based wl selection
- Implement the parameter orthogonalisation algorithm (Roger et al., 2003)

------------- Longer term --------------------

- File-based storage of big collections
- Integration of a viewer, possibly using playwith, to
manipulate (eg crop) the spectra in a collection.
