-------------- Short term --------------------

- Re-write DESCRIPTION file, esp. Imports/Suggests part
- implement "[<-" (like australia[,'PC1',] <- NULL) 
- order of rows, cols, spectra in `[` --> use rows, spectra, cols
- implement how to delete features from @data slot
- moving average/moving window stuff?
- how to reduce number of WLs by interpolation?
- Binning
- Matrix operations (maybe this could just be done by using spectra(foo)?)
- sweep() would be good as well
- splice correction using signal::interp(1)
- plot(foo, attr = 'bar') for base graphics. -- (well maybe not after all, that's what the gg mode is for. ltraeillis graphics are just better at this IMHO)

- Documentation, documentation
- Begin to work on vignettes:
  * introduction vignette --> Creation and maniuplation, basic stuff like PCA, k-means and hclust
  * analysis vignette
  * graphics vignette
  * spatial vignette --> PC study, raster overlays
  * hacking with inspectr: how and when to hook your own 
    functions in, how to work with other packages
  * soil vignette

- Push the SpatialSpectraDataFrame class

- allow rbind to work on Spectra + SpectraDataFrames (including NA for Spectra individuals)
- what about cbind/strategy to add wavelengths to a collection?

- Implement a sample.Spectra() method, including various spectra sampling strategies:
  * random
  * KS
  * OptiSim
  * K-means
  * DBSCAN
  * ref: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0003-2670(02)00651-7

- Push the Kennard-Stone and OptiSim algorithms for sampling

- outlier analysis methods (Mahalonobis?) --> Just an illustration in the vignette, use package:chemometrics
- 2D correlation between two sets of spectra --> same

- Document how to centre the spectra --> apply_spectra(foo, scale)
- Implement wavelet-based wl selection
- Implement the parameter orthogonalisation algorithm (Roger et al., 2003)
- conversion to and from hyperSpec
- Re-do Viscarra-Rossel & Behrens (2010) with inspectr

------------- Longer term --------------------

- File-based storage of big collections
- Integration of a viewer, possibly using playwith, to
manipulate (eg crop) the spectra in a collection.
